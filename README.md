# Simple Avoider Game
An avoider game created in Paper.js, just for fun

An ever-increasing number of enemies appear at random locations--although not too close to the player. They will continue to follow you around until they eventually hunt you down (there's no way to win). The images used are random pictures of some friends, who were a bit surprised at what I'd created.

Play the game at nward.co/paperjs_game!
